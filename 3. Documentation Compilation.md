# HBnB Evolution Technical Documentation

## I. Introduction

This technical documentation serves as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB Evolution project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the systemâ€™s architecture and design. This document includes diagrams and explanatory notes that describe the high-level architecture, business logic layer, and API interaction flow of the application.

## II. High-Level Architecture

The HBnB Evolution application follows a layered architecture divided into three main layers: the Presentation Layer, the Business Logic Layer, and the Persistence Layer. The high-level package diagram (Figure 1) illustrates this architecture and the interactions between the layers.

![0. High-Level Package Diagram.drawio.png](https://github.com/thomas-maye/holbertonschool-HBnB_Project_UML/blob/e1a54703d01fbd47253af6fabae26d534c101492/0.%20High-Level%20Package%20Diagram.drawio.png)

_Figure 1 : High-Level Package Diagram_

In the context of our project, the HBnB Evolution application, the three layers of the architecture are as follows:

* __Presentation Layer (Services, API)__: This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. In our project, the Presentation Layer will include the user interface of the application, which will allow users to register, update their profiles, list properties, leave reviews, and manage amenities. The Presentation Layer will also expose APIs that can be used by third-party applications to interact with the HBnB Evolution application.

* __Business Logic Layer (Models)__: This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity). In our project, the Business Logic Layer will handle the main functionalities of the application, such as user registration, place creation, review submission, and amenity management. The Business Logic Layer will also ensure that the business rules and requirements outlined in the project specifications are enforced.

* __Persistence Layer__: This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. In our project, the Persistence Layer will interact directly with the database to perform CRUD operations on the User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities. The Persistence Layer will ensure that the data is stored and retrieved efficiently and securely.

The use of the facade pattern in our project simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface. In this case, the ServiceAPI in the Presentation Layer acts as a facade, allowing the Presentation Layer to interact with the Business Logic Layer without needing to know the complexities of the underlying system. This improves the overall usability and maintainability of the application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In summary, our project, the HBnB Evolution application, fits into the layered architecture design by dividing the application into three main layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence. The Presentation Layer handles the interaction between the user and the application, the Business Logic Layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system, and the Persistence Layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. The use of the facade pattern simplifies interactions between layers, improving the overall usability and maintainability of the application. The documentation of the architecture and design using UML diagrams will serve as a blueprint for the development phase, ensuring that the application is developed according to the specified design and requirements.

## III. Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic Layer is the heart of the application, containing the entities and their relationships that define the core business logic. The detailed class diagram (Figure 2) illustrates the entities, their attributes, methods, and relationships within this layer.

![1. Detailed Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer.drawio.png](https://github.com/thomas-maye/holbertonschool-HBnB_Project_UML/blob/34fc6b0c98f66fd5b2309278712979ce12fb66a5/1.%20Detailed%20Class%20Diagram%20for%20Business%20Logic%20Layer.drawio.png)

_Figure 2 : Detailed Class Diagram for the Business Logic Layer_

On the context of our project, the HBnB Evolution application, the detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer shows the internal structure of the layer, including the key entities, their attributes, methods, and relationships.

The different classes in our project are:

__User__: This entity represents a user of the HBnB Evolution application. It has attributes such as `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `password`, `is_admin`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. We have also taken the liberty of adding a few attributes that will be useful to us in the construction of our HBnB project: `is_owner`, `properties`, `coment.review`, `average(rating.review)`. It also has methods such as `register()`, `update_profile()`, and `delete()`. A user can own multiple places and leave multiple reviews.

__Place__: This entity represents a property listed on the HBnB Evolution application. It has attributes such as `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. Here too, we have taken the liberty of creating complementary attributes: `owner`, `coment.review`, `rating.review`, and `average(rating.review)`. It also has methods such as `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()`. A place is owned by a single user and can have multiple amenities and reviews.

__Review__: This entity represents a review left by a user for a place. It has attributes such as `id`, `comment`, `rating`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. It also has methods such as `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()`. A review is left by a single user for a single place.

__Amenity__: This entity represents an amenity that can be associated with a place. It has attributes such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. It also has methods such as `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()`. A place can have multiple amenities.

In the context of the class diagram for the Business Logic layer of the HBnB Evolution application, we have used association links to represent the relationships between entities. This is because association links are used to show relationships between objects that have no ownership or inheritance relationship.

* A user can own multiple places, so the relationship between User and Place is one-to-many. This means that a single user can be associated with multiple places, but each place is owned by only one user. Since there is no ownership or inheritance relationship between User and Place, we use an association link to represent this relationship.

* A user can leave multiple reviews, so the relationship between User and Review is one-to-many. This means that a single user can be associated with multiple reviews, but each review is left by only one user. Since there is no ownership or inheritance relationship between User and Review, we use an association link to represent this relationship.

* A place can have multiple reviews, so the relationship between Place and Review is one-to-many. This means that a single place can be associated with multiple reviews, but each review is left for only one place. Since there is no ownership or inheritance relationship between Place and Review, we use an association link to represent this relationship.

* A place can have multiple amenities, so the relationship between Place and Amenity is one-to-many. This means that a single place can be associated with multiple amenities, but each amenity can be associated with only one place. Since there is no ownership or inheritance relationship between Place and Amenity, we use an association link to represent this relationship.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using association links to represent these relationships allows us to clearly show the connections between entities without implying any ownership or inheritance relationships. This helps to ensure that the diagram accurately reflects the structure and behavior of the application.

The detailed class diagram for the Business Logic layer of the HBnB Evolution application provides a clear and detailed visual representation of the core business logic, focusing on the key entities: User, Place, Review, and Amenity. The diagram shows the internal structure of the layer, including the attributes and methods of each entity, and the relationships between them. The diagram will serve as a blueprint for the development phase, ensuring that the application is developed according to the specified design and requirements.

# IV. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

The purpose of these diagrams is to show how each users action interact with data. We gonna use a User Case to explain the API Calls and the user journey.

## 1. Sequence Diagram User Registration
### User case :
* User is already on the site.

* User clicks on "Register New Account.

* The API validates user data if the form fields are correctly filled.

* Check if the data for the new user doesn't already exist.

* If the data doesn't exist, create a new user and save it in the database.

* The database confirms the save to Business Logic.

* Business Logic returns a successful registration.

* The API returns a success registration message to the user.
