# HBnB Evolution Technical Documentation

## I. Introduction

This technical documentation serves as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB Evolution project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the systemâ€™s architecture and design. This document includes diagrams and explanatory notes that describe the high-level architecture, business logic layer, and API interaction flow of the application.

## II. High-Level Architecture

The HBnB Evolution application follows a layered architecture divided into three main layers: the Presentation Layer, the Business Logic Layer, and the Persistence Layer. The facade pattern is used to facilitate communication between these layers. The high-level package diagram (Figure 1) illustrates this architecture and the interactions between the layers.

In the context of our project, the HBnB Evolution application, the three layers of the architecture are as follows:

Presentation Layer (Services, API): This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. In our project, the Presentation Layer will include the user interface of the application, which will allow users to register, update their profiles, list properties, leave reviews, and manage amenities. The Presentation Layer will also expose APIs that can be used by third-party applications to interact with the HBnB Evolution application.

Business Logic Layer (Models): This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity). In our project, the Business Logic Layer will handle the main functionalities of the application, such as user registration, place creation, review submission, and amenity management. The Business Logic Layer will also ensure that the business rules and requirements outlined in the project specifications are enforced.

Persistence Layer: This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. In our project, the Persistence Layer will interact directly with the database to perform CRUD operations on the User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities. The Persistence Layer will ensure that the data is stored and retrieved efficiently and securely.

The use of the facade pattern in our project simplifies interactions between layers by providing a unified interface. In this case, the ServiceAPI in the Presentation Layer acts as a facade, allowing the Presentation Layer to interact with the Business Logic Layer without needing to know the complexities of the underlying system. This improves the overall usability and maintainability of the application.

In summary, our project, the HBnB Evolution application, fits into the layered architecture design by dividing the application into three main layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence. The Presentation Layer handles the interaction between the user and the application, the Business Logic Layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system, and the Persistence Layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. The use of the facade pattern simplifies interactions between layers, improving the overall usability and maintainability of the application. The documentation of the architecture and design using UML diagrams will serve as a blueprint for the development phase, ensuring that the application is developed according to the specified design and requirements.

## III. Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic Layer is the heart of the application, containing the entities and their relationships that define the core business logic. The detailed class diagram (Figure 2) illustrates the entities, their attributes, methods, and relationships within this layer.

Figure 2 : Detailed Class Diagram for the Business Logic Layer

The primary entities in the Business Logic Layer are User, Place, Review, and Amenity. The User entity represents a user of the application, with attributes such as first name, last name, email, and password. The Place entity represents a property listed by a user, with attributes such as title, description, price, latitude, and longitude. The Review entity represents a review left by a user for a place, with attributes such as rating and comment. The Amenity entity represents an amenity that can be associated with a place.

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

A User can own multiple Places, and a Place is owned by a User.
A User can leave multiple Reviews, and a Review is left by a User.
A Place can have multiple Reviews, and a Review is associated with a Place.
A Place can have multiple Amenities, and an Amenity can be associated with multiple Places.
