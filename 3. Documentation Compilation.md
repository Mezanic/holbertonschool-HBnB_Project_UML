# HBnB Evolution Technical Documentation

## I. Introduction

This technical documentation serves as a detailed blueprint for the HBnB Evolution project, guiding the implementation phases and providing a clear reference for the systemâ€™s architecture and design. This document includes diagrams and explanatory notes that describe the high-level architecture, business logic layer, and API interaction flow of the application.

## II. High-Level Architecture

The HBnB Evolution application follows a layered architecture divided into three main layers: the Presentation Layer, the Business Logic Layer, and the Persistence Layer. The facade pattern is used to facilitate communication between these layers. The high-level package diagram (Figure 1) illustrates this architecture and the interactions between the layers.

The Presentation Layer includes the services and API through which users interact with the system. The Business Logic Layer contains the models and the core logic of the application. The Persistence Layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.

## III. Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic Layer is the heart of the application, containing the entities and their relationships that define the core business logic. The detailed class diagram (Figure 2) illustrates the entities, their attributes, methods, and relationships within this layer.

The primary entities in the Business Logic Layer are User, Place, Review, and Amenity. The User entity represents a user of the application, with attributes such as first name, last name, email, and password. The Place entity represents a property listed by a user, with attributes such as title, description, price, latitude, and longitude. The Review entity represents a review left by a user for a place, with attributes such as rating and comment. The Amenity entity represents an amenity that can be associated with a place.

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

A User can own multiple Places, and a Place is owned by a User.
A User can leave multiple Reviews, and a Review is left by a User.
A Place can have multiple Reviews, and a Review is associated with a Place.
A Place can have multiple Amenities, and an Amenity can be associated with multiple Places.
